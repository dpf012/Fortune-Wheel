# About Fortune-Wheel
Created a version of the Wheel of Fortune game where the computer will load a file that has both categories and puzzles. The computer will randomly choose one category/puzzle for the single player to solve. The players will then guess a letter. The program will check three things: 1. If the guess is a letter from the puzzle, 2. If the guess completes the puzzle, and 3. If the guess has not already been guessed. The game ends when all of the letters in the puzzle have been guessed. In this version, the player can never lose.
